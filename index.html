                <h2>Their lives depend on your donation</h2>
                <p>There are things that everyone can do to help those who need it. Even small actions and small donations make a difference. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>
                <p>Depending on the situation, a relief group may need donations of food, water, or other supplies. They may need volunteers for a clean-up project, or to set up homes for refugees, or to pack boxes of food or supplies</p>

                <p>Flood-susceptible areas include valleys, plains, canyons, swamplands, the coasts, and anywhere near large bodies of water. </p>
                <p>Did You Know: Hurricanes, the most violent storms on Earth, are more dangerous because of flooding than high winds. Also, if hurricane rains occur in an area which is already saturated with water, this increases the chance of flooding—possibly across hundreds of miles inland! </p>
